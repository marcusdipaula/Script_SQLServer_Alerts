# SQL Server Alerts

Hi Guys!

In this repository, I'd like to share with you a project that i'm developing for years and using with our clients.

This is a big project where I'm sharing some scripts to monitor SQL Server if you don't have a tool to do that.

In 2017 I released the version 1.0:

* <https://www.fabriciolima.net/blog/2017/05/01/criando-um-e-mail-de-checklist-diario-no-sql-server/>
* <https://www.fabriciolima.net/blog/2017/10/05/video-criando-15-alertas-no-sql-server-em-apenas-5-minutos/>

Now, in September-2019, I released the version 2.0:

* I will still do a blog post explaining how to use this script in English. (Pending)
* For now I recorded only a video in portuguese explaining how to create the alerts.

## How install

* [Download latest release](https://github.com/soupowertuning/Script_SQLServer_Alerts/releases/latest)
  * **Tip**: You can clone using some git client or manually download this repository
* All scripts can be found on [scripts directory](scripts/) 
* To get started, follow the instructions on file [scripts/1.0.StepByStep.sql](scripts/1.0.StepByStep.sql)
